## What can you do?
Notely is Full-Stack App for notes. You can create, edit, delete notes. This repo contains both frontend and backend. Frontend is written in React and backend is written in ExpressJS. For ORM I use Prisma.

## How to set up the Frontend?
To set up the frontend, you need to clone the repo and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
You need to add .env file next to .env.example with API_URL.

## How to set up the Backend?
To set up the backend, you need create .env file next to .env.example and add varaibles, that are icluded in .env.example file.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
